# ML and Climate Project Journal


### 10/4/22

Earlier this year, I pondered upon an [web article](https://sustainabilitymag.com/esg/how-nvidia-fighting-climate-change-omniverse) article about US gaming and computer graphics how they were tackling climate change. As a gaming and computer enthusiast, this article sounded very interesting. GPU's by far, consume alot of electricty and are major contributors in household electricty (myself included). Further, with the boom of crypto mining, many people over the last year have been buying several GPU's in hopes of one day becoming a crytpo giant. 

In the same article, Nvidia stated that they reduced their emissions by 15% per employee and set a goal to have 65% of its global electricity use come from renewable sources by the end of 2025. Along these lines, I decided to do my project regarding modeling GPU efficiency and how that ties into future energy consumption.

At the moment, I have been looking for a dataset for this task. I could curate my own dataset but I believe it would be too small to create valid and accurate predictions.

After further research, I have realized that my initial project that included GPU data is extremely hard to find. So, I have deviated my project. My new project does still involve household emissions but in terms of CO2 equivalent. The data I have collected is from https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=air_ghg#. The project will put an emphasis on emissions from the residential sector. In addition, I will compare trends over time from 1990 to 2020 and observe how policies and laws have added value/ altered the charts. Further, using machine learning I will predict emissions for the current year and future.

The project is divided into two main phases: 
- Observing Trends in various countries CO2 emissions over time (1990-2020) and analyse climate policies to uncover trends and ties.
- Predict future emission data (2021,2022 and 2050) and inspect course.
