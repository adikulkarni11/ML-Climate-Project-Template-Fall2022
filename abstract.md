Collectively, the human race emits around 51 billion tonnes of CO2e each year. With topics such as climate change and sustainability management on the rise, people are figuring out ways to solve global warming and its effects. On a much more personal level, we can see each household contributing to climate change. This project is a proof of concept to delve out certain patterns or ideas within residential households to support climate change. 

My project revolves around household emissions but in terms of CO2 equivalent. The data I have collected is from https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=air_ghg#. The project will put an emphasis on emissions from the residential sector. In addition, I will compare trends over time from 1990 to this year and observe how policies and laws have added value/altered the charts. Further, using machine learning I will predict emissions for the current year and future.

The project is divided into two main phases:

- Observing Trends in various countries CO2 emissions over time (1990-2020) and analyse climate policies to uncover trends and ties.
- Predict future emission data (2021,2022 and 2050) and inspect course.
