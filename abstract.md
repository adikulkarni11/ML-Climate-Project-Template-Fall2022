The human race collectively emits approximately 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)
per year. In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the trajectory and contributed to a
record high in residential emissions. Every household has an impact on climate change, and the residential
sector is responsible for a significant portion (20%) of total emissions. As the importance of addressing
climate change and sustainability management becomes increasingly recognized, there is a growing need
for solutions to combat global warming and its effects.
Through machine learning, this research project aims to uncover patterns and insights within residential
households that can support climate change efforts in the current environment, where publicly available
emission data is scarce. By examining the relationship between climate change policy and residential
CO2e emissions at a macro scale, our study provides a detailed and comprehensive understanding of
the connection between these factors through various case studies and forecasting models. Overall, this
project provides a valuable starting point for further studies in sparse data emission tracking models.


My project revolves around household emissions but in terms of CO2 equivalent. The data I have collected is from https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=air_ghg#. The project will put an emphasis on emissions from the residential sector. In addition, I will compare trends over time from 1990 to this year and observe how policies and laws have added value/altered the charts. Further, using machine learning I will predict emissions for the current year and future.

The project is divided into two main phases:

- Observing Trends in various countries CO2 emissions over time (1990-2020) and analyse climate policies to uncover trends and ties.
- Predict future emission data (2021,2022 and 2050) and inspect course.
