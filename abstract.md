My project revolves around household emissions but in terms of CO2 equivalent. The data I have collected is from https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=air_ghg#. The project will put an emphasis on emissions from the residential sector. In addition, I will compare trends over time from 1990 to 2020 and observe how policies and laws have added value/ altered the charts. Further, using machine learning I will predict emissions for the current year and future.

The project is divided into two main phases:

- Observing Trends in various countries CO2 emissions over time (1990-2020) and analyse climate policies to uncover trends and ties.
- Predict future emission data (2021,2022 and 2050) and inspect course.
